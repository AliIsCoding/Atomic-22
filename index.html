      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Introduction</h5>

      <p class="text-muted">I have very major news, everyone! My Science Team, The NRC (The Nuclear Radiation Corp) has just figured out that North Korea has been preparing to launch 3+ chemical weapons in the USA, in 4 different locations! Don’t worry, highly trained professionals have already informed the president. We have also sent paramedics to all states to the USA preparing to evacuate. I am writing this article in order to inform you on how to treat the radiation that comes from chemical reactions! Especially to the Digestive System and Circulatory System.

      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Where it came from</h5>

      <p class="text-muted">A few months ago, we sent a highly trained professional into North Korea. He has sent us very useful information about what is going on in North Korea. Unfortunately, it wasn’t long before the North Korean Army found out that he was a spy. So they decided to launch the chemical weapon on him! In his last words in his final letter, he told us about how the chemicals would affect your Digestive and Circulatory System, and I am here to explain that to you.

      <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>What happens you get the chemicals inside your body?</kbd></h4>

      <hr>

      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Symptoms</h5>

      <p class="text-muted">First, once they launch the chemical weapons, the chemicals would go into the air causing the air to get filled with dangerous toxins and chemicals. Yes, it does damage your lungs but it wants you to think it does when in reality, the chemicals have already entered your body and are trying to damage your blood cells. Before you realize it, your heart has stopped! 

        Now, you might be thinking, if you are vaccinated from the COVID-19 you are probably going to have a high chance of living, but NO. Once the chemicals are in your blood, you have to think. What system gives your blood nutrients? The Digestive System! First, the small intestines are going to get damaged because they are the organ that actually gives the nutrients! And once the chemicals have reached your stomach, you are going to have severe stomach aches and according to our researches, even start coughing out blood!

      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Conclusion</h5>

      <p class="text-muted">Now, don’t be afraid, we have already prepared for months for this and have already found out different ways to defend yourself from the disease! First, if you live in countries such as Mexico, Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, please wear a gas mask if possible! Plus, we have prepared a Turbo shot for defending yourself against the chemicals. Finally, please stay safe and I hope for the best!
